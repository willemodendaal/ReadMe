Hello, this is me.

I'm a software developer. I started coding at age 10 when I wanted to play Leisure Suit Larry, but my dad said "No" and showed me GW Basic instead. And that changed my life.

Programming is what I've always wanted to do, and what I've done for 17+ years professionally. Living the dream, right? Except all work comes with challenges, and the programming industry is tough. So I had a particularly bad burnout in 2020 and realized things needed to change.

This is an attempt to work healthier, and most importantly, more transparently.
